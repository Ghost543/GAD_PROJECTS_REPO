# GAD_PROJECTS_REPO
My name is MUWANGUZI PETER am on cloud track on the GAD scholarship and here is my project solutions.
I tried puting every project in its directory.
I split the project into two directories namely '100% Command line accomplished labs' and 'GCP Console'
So in the '100% Command line accomplished labs' its Where labs done with only the Cloud Shell and in 'GCP Console' i just followed what the labs where suggesting.
